# Amazon Glue Studio

Amazon Glue Studio is a new graphical interface that makes it easy to create, run, and monitor extract, transform, and load (ETL) jobs in Amazon Glue. You can visually compose data transformation workflows and seamlessly run them on Amazon Glueâ€™s Apache Spark-based serverless ETL engine. You can inspect the schema and data results in each step of the job.
