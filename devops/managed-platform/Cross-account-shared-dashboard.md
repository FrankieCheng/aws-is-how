# Cross-Account/Region Dashboard 

Amazon CloudWatch support Cross-account and cross-region dashboards. It is easier for customers to monitor, analyse and troubleshoot applications that span multiple AWS accounts and regions. 

With this feature, customers can create high level operational dashboards with one-click drilldowns into more specific dashboards in different accounts, without having to log in and out of different accounts or switching regions. 

Customers can define cross-account cross-region dashboards that visualize, aggregate, and summarize performance and operational data, making it easier to analyse, diagnose, and isolate issues and reducing time to resolution.
