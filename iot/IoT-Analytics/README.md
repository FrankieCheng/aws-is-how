# IoT Analytics workshop

AWS IoT Analytics automates collect, store, process, and query the device data from IoT devices. AWS IoT Analytics filters, transforms (for example, apply mathematical transforms), and enriches IoT data (for example, enrich the data with device-specific metadata such as device type and location) before storing it in a time-series data store for analysis. Then, you can analyze your data by running queries using the built-in SQL query engine, or perform more complex analytics and machine learning inference. AWS IoT Analytics enables advanced data exploration through integration with Jupyter Notebook and Amazon Athena. AWS IoT Analytics also enables data visualization through integration with Amazon QuickSight
