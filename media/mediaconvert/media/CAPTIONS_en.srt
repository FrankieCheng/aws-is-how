1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:10,500
This blade has a dark past.

2
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:20,800
It has shed much innocent blood.

3
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:39,800
You're a fool for traveling alone,
so completely unprepared.

4
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:49,800
You're lucky your blood's still flowing.

5
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:59,800
Thank you.

6
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:09,800
So...

7
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:19,800
What brings you to
the land of the gatekeepers?

8
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:29,800
I'm searching for someone.

9
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:39,800
Someone very dear?
A kindred spirit?

10
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:49,800
A dragon.

11
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:59,800
A dangerous quest for a lone hunter.

12
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:35,870
I've been alone for
as long as I can remember.

13
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,500
We're almost done. Shhh...

14
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,500
Hey, sit still.

15
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:52,250
Good night, Scales.

16
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:13,850
Get him, Scales! Come on!

17
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,250
Scales?

18
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,500
Yeah! Come on!

19
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:42,000
Scales!

20
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:27,500
I have failed.

21
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,500
You've only failed to see...

22
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,500
These are dragon lands, Sintel.

23
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:44,000
You are closer than you know.

24
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,500
Scales!

25
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,000
Scales?

26
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,800
Scales...
